🗺️ Geography: The world is mostly covered in sprawling cities, with only a few patches of wilderness remaining. These cities are divided into different districts, each with their own unique vibe and culture. The most valuable resources in this world are data and information, which are controlled by large corporations that dominate the economy.
📜 History: The world was once a place of progress and innovation, but it all came crashing down when a massive data leak exposed the corrupt practices of the largest corporations. The ensuing chaos led to the collapse of many governments and the rise of these corporations as the new ruling powers. The world has been in a constant state of cyber warfare ever since, with each corporation vying for control and dominance.
🌐 Cultures: Each district has its own distinct culture, with its own set of customs, beliefs, and social structures. In the neon-lit streets of the entertainment district, pleasure and vice are the primary currencies, and people come from all over the world to indulge their desires. In the financial district, money and power rule, and the wealthy elite live in towering skyscrapers while the working class toil in the factories and offices below. In the underground hacker district, skilled individuals use their tech-savvy and quick wits to survive and thrive in the shadows.
💼 Societies: Each corporation has its own unique political system and economic structure, with the most powerful corporations controlling entire districts or even entire cities.
